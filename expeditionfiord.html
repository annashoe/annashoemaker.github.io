										<p>It is surprising to encounter active saline spring activity at a constant 6°C temperature year-round not far away from the North Pole, 
											at latitude 79°24′N, where the permafrost is ca. 600 m thick and average annual temperature is -15°C. These perennial springs in Expedition Fiord, 
											Queen Elizabeth Islands, Canadian Arctic Archipelago, had previously been explained as a recent, periglacial process. However, the discovery near 
											White Glacier (79°26.66′N; 90°42.20′W; 350 m.a.s.l.) of a network of veins of hydrothermal origin with a similar mineralogy to travertine precipitates 
											formed by the springs suggests that their fluids have much deeper circulation and are related to evaporite structures°(salt diapirs) that underlie the area. 
											The relatively high minimum trapping temperature of the fluid inclusions (avg. ~200 ± 45 C, 1σ) in carbonate and quartz in the vein array, and in quartz veins 
											west of the site, explains a local thermal anomaly detected through low-temperature thermochronology. This paper reviews and updates descriptive features of 
											the perennial springs in Expedition Fiord and compares their mineralogy, geochemistry, and geology to the vein array by White Glacier, which is interpreted 
											as a hydrothermal predecessor of the springs. The perennial springs in Axel Heiberg Island are known for half a century and have been extensively described 
											in the literature. Discharging spring waters are hypersaline (1-4 molal NaCl; ~5 to 19 wt% NaCl) and precipitate Fe-sulfides, sulfates, carbonates, and 
											halides with acicular and banded textures representing discharge pulsations. At several sites, waters and sediments by spring outlets host microbial 
											communities that are supported by carbon- and energy-rich reduced substrates including sulfur and methane. They have been studied as possible analogs 
											for life-supporting environments in Mars. The vein array at White Glacier consists of steep to subhorizontal veins, mineralized fractures, and breccias 
											within a gossan area of ca. 350 × 50 m. The host rock is altered diabase and a chaotic matrix-supported breccia composed of limestone, sandstone, and 
											anhydrite-gypsum. Mineralization consists of brown calcite (pseudomorph after aragonite) in radial aggregates as linings of fractures and cavities, with 
											transparent, sparry calcite and quartz at the centre of larger cavities. Abundant sulfides pyrite and marcasite and minor chalcopyrite, sphalerite, and 
											galena occur in masses and veins, much like in base metal deposits known as Mississippi Valley Type; their weathering is responsible for brown Fe oxides 
											forming a gossan. Epidote and chlorite rim veins where the host rock is Fe- and Mg-rich diabase. The banded carbonate textures with organic matter and 
											sulfides are reminiscent of textures observed in mineral precipitates forming in the active springs at Colour Peak Diapir. Very small fluid inclusions 
											(5-10 μm) in two generations of vein calcite (hexagonal, early brown calcite we denominate “cal1” lining vein walls; white-orange sparry calcite “cal2” 
											infilling veins) have bulk salinities that transition between an early, high-salinity end-member brine (up to ~20 wt% NaCl equivalent) to a later, 
											low-salinity end-member fluid (nearly pure water) and show large fluctuations in salinity with time. Inclusions that occupy secondary planes and 
											also growth zones in the later calcite infilling (deemed primary) have T h ranging from 100°C to 300°C (n = 120, average~200° C; independent of salinity), 
											2 orders of magnitude higher than average discharging water temperatures of 6°C at Colour Peak Diapir. Carbon isotope composition (δ13CVPDB) of the 
											White Glacier vein array carbonates ranges from approximately -20 to -30‰, like carbonates formed by the degradation of petroleum, whereas carbonates 
											at Colour Peak Diapir springs have a value of -10‰. Oxygen isotopecomposition (δ18OVSMOW) of vein carbonates ranges from -0.3‰ to +3.5‰, compatible 
											with a coeval fluid at 250°C with a composition from -3.5‰ to -7.0‰. These data are consistent with carbonates having precipitated from mixtures of 
											heated formational waters and high-latitude meteoric waters. In contrast, the δ18OVSMOW value for carbonates at Colour Peak Diapir springs is +10‰, 
											derived from high-latitude meteoric waters at 6°C. The sulfur isotope (δ34SVCDT) composition of Fe-sulfides at the perennial springs is +19.2‰, similar 
											to the δ34SVCDT of Carboniferous-age sulfate of the diapirs and consistent with low- temperature microbial reduction of finite (closed-system) sulfate. 
											The δ34SVCDT values of Fe-sulfides in the vein array range from -2.7‰ to +16.4‰, possibly reflecting higher formation temperatures involving reduction of 
											sulfate by organics. We suggest that the similar setting, mineralogical compositions, and textures between the hydrothermal vein array and the active 
											Colour Peak Diapir springs imply a kinship. We suggest that overpressured basinal fluids expelled from the sedimentary package and deforming salt 
											bodies at depth during regional compressional tectonic deformation ca. 50 million years ago (Eocene) during what is known as the Eurekan Orogeny 
											created (by hydrofracturing) the vein array at White Glacier (and probably other similar ones), and the network of conduits created continued to be a 
											pathway around salt bodies for deeply circulating fluids to this day. Fluid inclusion data suggest that the ancient conduit system was at one point too 
											hot to support life but may have been since colonized by microorganisms as the system cooled. Thermochronology data suggest that the hydrologic system 
											cooled to temperatures possibly sustaining life about 10 million years ago, making it since then a viable analogue environment for the establishment of 
											microbial life in similar situations on other planets.</p>
